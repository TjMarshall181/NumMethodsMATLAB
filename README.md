# NumMethodsMATLAB
__________________________________________________
This directory contains various algorithms to perform various numerical methods for engineering application.


Each algorithm is run through MATLAB and have been created for learning purposes as well as conventional purposes. 


NOTE: Each algorithm can be done using built in function in MATLAB, however these algorithms where created for my own personal development in writing code and practicing Numerical Methods.
